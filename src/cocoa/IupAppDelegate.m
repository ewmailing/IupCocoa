// This is the callback for things like people double-clicking on an associated file, or dragging a file onto the Dock icon
// If the user opens the app via a file, this gets called before applicationDidFinishLaunching: (but after applicationWillFinishLaunching:)
/* We need to make some decisions on how to launch an IUP app supporting this kind of feature, and also URLs and Universal Deep App Links:
- Change ENTRYPOINT to pass back parameters (or set attributes the user can query).
	- Downsides: This means deferred actions, so if the method expects the user to return true/false, that is not possible.
			- Unless: We can trigger ENTRYPOINT with attributes at the correct time, and we need to change the ENTRYPOINT signature to return int to signal the caller.
		- Also, we still need a callback to handle the case where the app is already running.

- Add new specific callbacks (ENTRYPOINTFILE, ENTRYPOINTURL, ENTRYPOINTAPPLINK).
	- Downsides: Must decide if ENTRYPOINT is still called, and if so, decide if before or after.
	- User needs to be aware of more possible launch start points.
	- If the user put all their init code into ENTRYPOINT, they will probably have to do some annoying refactoring to figure out how to share code.
 
 
 - Since application:openFiles: doesn't have a return value, and application:openFile:'s return value doesn't seem to do anything,
	- it seems a separate callback that fires after ENTRYPOINT may be the easiest for the users.

- We should compare with other platforms before making a final decision.

// Update: This is also the callback Apple uses to open a file from the Recent File Menu.
// This adds an additional constraint because we cannot distinguish what action invoked this.

*/
// NOTE: application:openFiles: overrides application:openFile:.
// If application:openFiles: is defined, application:openFile: will never be invoked.
// Instead application:openFiles: will be invoked, but with only file in the array.
// And if multiple files are dragged when application:openFile: is ued, it just gets invoked multiple times.
// So it might be preferrable to use application:openFiles:
//
// NOTE: You must declare file types in your Info.plist for this to take effect.

// We need to override the built-in IUP implementation and use the native Cocoa API.
// 1) Sandboxing requires we use the native API, otherwise we won't have permission to access files between launches.
// (We could try to use Security Scoped Bookmarks directly, but because they are not referenced counted, we have to be careful if the user still wants a reference.
// Also, Iup doesn't provide us a convenient API to work with that maps to SSB. It really would benefit from having an entire Ihandle* object, like IupClipboard does.)
//
// 2) Apple updates at least both the Main Menu Recent Files and also the Dock contextual menu. (Are there others?).
//
// 3) The standard .XIB Main Menu file has special hooks for Recent Files so NSDocumentController can modify it.
// If we muck with it so we can manually modify it, we break that. We must pick one or the other.
// In early versions, I went the manual modify route, but was not thinking about the Sandbox or Dock menu yet.
// I reverted to the standard XIB because it is the most correct thing to do.
//
// For our override, we pretty much ignore EVERYTHING IUP normally does.
// menu is useless to us.
// recent_cb won't work for us using the legacy signature because ours must be shared with OPENFILES_CB due to how the native API works.
// max_recent is useless to us because we can't programatically set the value. (Users set it in their System Preferences.)
// ih is useless to use because we don't write any of these values to IupConfig and all our interaction is done through NSDocuementController.
