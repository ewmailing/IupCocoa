// This is the callback for things like people double-clicking on an associated file, or dragging a file onto the Dock icon
// If the user opens the app via a file, this gets called before applicationDidFinishLaunching: (but after applicationWillFinishLaunching:)
/* We need to make some decisions on how to launch an IUP app supporting this kind of feature, and also URLs and Universal Deep App Links:
- Change ENTRYPOINT to pass back parameters (or set attributes the user can query).
	- Downsides: This means deferred actions, so if the method expects the user to return true/false, that is not possible.
			- Unless: We can trigger ENTRYPOINT with attributes at the correct time, and we need to change the ENTRYPOINT signature to return int to signal the caller.
		- Also, we still need a callback to handle the case where the app is already running.

- Add new specific callbacks (ENTRYPOINTFILE, ENTRYPOINTURL, ENTRYPOINTAPPLINK).
	- Downsides: Must decide if ENTRYPOINT is still called, and if so, decide if before or after.
	- User needs to be aware of more possible launch start points.
	- If the user put all their init code into ENTRYPOINT, they will probably have to do some annoying refactoring to figure out how to share code.
 
 
 - Since application:openFiles: doesn't have a return value, and application:openFile:'s return value doesn't seem to do anything,
	- it seems a separate callback that fires after ENTRYPOINT may be the easiest for the users.

- We should compare with other platforms before making a final decision.
