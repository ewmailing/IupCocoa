<p>The spirit of this license is that you are free to use the libraries for any 
purpose at no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is that if you

below somewhere in your product or its documentation. A nice, but optional, way 
to give us further credit is to include a Tecgraf logo and a link to our site in 
a web page for your product. </p>
<p>The libraries are designed, implemented and maintained by a team at 
Tecgraf/PUC-Rio in Brazil. The implementation is not derived from licensed 
software. The library was developed by request of Petrobras. Petrobras permits 
Tecgraf to distribute the library under the conditions here presented.</p>
