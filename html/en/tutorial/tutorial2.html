<h2>2. Hello World</h2>

<h3>2.1 <a name="Initialization">Initialization</a></h3>

<p>The code bellow will shows how to open an IUP environment and displays a simple message. Each line of code is explained after the code.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code 
<span class="example_button">[in C] <a target="example2_1" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_1.c">example2_1.c</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_1.c">
<img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span> <span class="example_button">[in Lua] <a target="example2_1" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_1.lua">example2_1.lua</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_1.lua"><img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example2_1.c" id="2_1" name="example2_1" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" style="height: 15em">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example2_1.png"></p>

<p>In the first line, we see an include of the C standard library,
which is needed by almost all C programs. Next there is an include for
the main IUP library, which is all we need for our first example. Next line is a 
standard main function declaration. Before running any of the IUP's functions, the function
<A href="../func/iupopen.html"><strong>IupOpen</strong></a> must be called to initialize the toolkit. The next line creates and
displays a message to the user using <A href="../dlg/iupmessage.html"><strong>IupMessage</strong></a> function. This function
receives from parameters: title and message. The title will be displayed at
the top of the message window and the message is a text message by itself that
will be displayed to the user. Following, we have a <A href="../func/iupclose.html"><strong>IupClose</strong></a> function 
call. After running the last IUP function, <A href="../func/iupclose.html"><strong>IupClose</strong></a> must be run so that 
the toolkit can free internal memory and close the interface system.
Finally the program returns to exit with success. </p>

<p>In Lua instead of <strong>includes</strong> it is necessary to <strong>require</strong> 
the packages we use. The require call replace the <A href="../func/iupopen.html"><strong>IupOpen</strong></a> function 
called in C. So <A href="../func/iupopen.html"><strong>IupOpen</strong></a> becomes 
<strong>require"iuplua"</strong> and like the includes it is done at the top of the code. This will inform Lua that the program described in the next lines
makes use of the package iuplua. Other important change from C to Lua is the way that IUP functions are called. The IUP 
calls in Lua uses the
prefix "iup." instead of "Iup" informing Lua to search for the function inside iuplua package. So, in this example we have: iup.Message instead of <A href="../func/iupmessage.html"><strong>IupMessage</strong></a> 
and iup.Close instead of <A href="../func/iupclose.html"><strong>IupClose</strong></a>. Another important aspect of using IUP with Lua is the fact that Lua is a interpreted language and a Lua program execute from the first line to the last one. So, there is no need to create a main 
function. We just call the iup.Message after the package inclusion. Yet, in the Lua 
version of our example you will find a call to 
<A href="../func/iupmainlooplevel.html"><strong>iup.MainLoopLevel</strong></a>. 
It will check if <A href="../func/iupmainloop.html"><strong>iup.MainLoop</strong></a> 
was already called to avoid calling it again. This is useful only if your script 
could be executed from inside another context, for regular applications there is 
no need for calling it. </p>


<h4>2.1.1 <a name="Compiling_Linking">Compiling</a> and Linking</h4>

<p>Compiling and Linking a program that uses IUP (as any other third party 
library that is not installed on the system) demands that you specify where the 
<strong>include</strong> files and the <strong>libraries</strong> are installed. You also need to 
link with the iup library. In order to do that in a single command line for our first example is as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">gcc -o example2_1 example2_1.o -liupimglib -liup -L../../../lib/$TEC_UNAME</pre>

<p> For programs containing several modules we suggest building a makefile (See 
here how to build one: <a href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/">makefile tutorial</a>). 
There are also many different IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) in Linux 
and in Windows that can help you develop an application. They all need the same 
basic settings to be configured. We also have guides available for the most 
popular IDEs:</p>

<h3>2.2 <a name="Dialog">Creating a Dialog</a></h3>

<p>Let's change the first example a little bit to add our own dialog.
</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code 
<span class="example_button">[in C] <a target="example2_2" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_2.c">example2_2.c</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_2.c">
<img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span> <span class="example_button">[in Lua] <a target="example2_2" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_2.lua">example2_2.lua</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_2.lua"><img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example2_2.c" id="2_2" name="example2_2" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" style="height: 23em">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img src="example2_2.png"></p>

<p>Note that we have added a new line in which we declare Ihandles* variables for 
IUP 
elements. We also have created two different variables. One called <strong>dlg</strong> for our 
main dialog and another called <strong>label</strong>, which will hold a label with a hello
message. Next, a new line creates a iup label control and 
associates it with the label Ihandle that was previously declared. Its 
only argument is the text that will be displayed inside the label. 
Then we reach the line in which we create our main dialog, almost in the same way that
we created the button. The difference goes on the parameter passed to <A href="../dlg/iupdialog.html"><strong>IupDialog</strong></a> function. 
It receives another function that will create a composition control called 
<A href="../elem/iupvbox.html"><strong>IupVbox</strong></a>. A <A href="../elem/iupvbox.html"><strong>IupVbox</strong></a> is a control that aligns all controls passed to it vertically. 
In this example, we are passing just one control (our label) and a NULL to sign 
that we are done with our list of elements. Next line presents the way in which IUP 
changes each control attributes. By calling the function <A href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a> the 
programmer will inform which control has the attribute that needs to be changed, 
which attribute is that and the new value that the attribute will assume. In our
sample, we are changing the main dialog's title to "Hello from IUP Tutorial". 
The next function is called <A href="../func/iupshowxy.html"><strong>IupShowXY</strong></a> and tells IUP that we need the main dialog displayed at 
the center of the screen horizontally and vertically. Following comes one of the 
most important function which is called in our program: <A href="../func/iupmainloop.html"><strong>IupMainLoop</strong></a>. This function tells 
iup to wait for events. Otherwise, the program would go on, end and terminate 
without dealing with any event. Go on, comment this line, recompile your code
and execute your program, and you will see the main dialog blink in the screen and 
the program ends just after it. It will be a valuable exercise.</p>

<p>From the most simple hello world to the most complex IUP application, all 
will have this same code structure. </p>

<p>In Lua we created the controls just after the iuplua package require. The 
controls construction have a different form in Lua, where the constructor name 
is all lower and its parameters are inside a table. Although you can, there is no need to use
<A href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>iup.SetAttribute</strong></a>. In Lua a control is also a table where the fields are the control attributes 
and callbacks. In the example all attributes were defined during the control creation, 
but we could also do label.title or dlg.title after calling the constructor. In 
Lua some functions also have a syntax sugar, so instead of using "iup.ShowXY(dlg, 
iup.CENTER,iup.CENTER)" we can write "dlg::showxy(iup.CENTER,iup.CENTER)" but 
both are exactly the same call.</p>

<h3>2.3 <a name="Interaction">Adding Interaction</a></h3>

<p>In the previous section, we saw how to build a basic IUP application, but 
without any custom interaction with the dialog. In this section, 
we will add interaction to our application using a button. 
</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code 
<span class="example_button">[in C] <a target="example2_3" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_3.c">example2_3.c</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_3.c">
<img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span> <span class="example_button">[in Lua] <a target="example2_3" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_3.lua">example2_3.lua</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_3.lua"><img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example2_3.c" id="2_3" name="example2_3" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" style="height: 36em">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img src="example2_3.png"></p>

<p>After the usual includes, we find some new lines. These lines
contain a regular function called btn_exit_cb that will be registered as our button callback, as will be seen next. This function does nothing
special, except showing the hello message that we saw in the first example and also closing 
the application returning code IUP_CLOSE. 
</p>

<p>Note that we have added a new handle that will handle our vbox in a clear way. 
Following is our button declaration. The first parameter is the title for the 
label, and the second parameter is a global name for a callback which use is 
now deprecated, so we simply set to NULL. The next lines are our vbox, which 
now is using a variable. That variable is passed as 
a parameter to the <A href="../dlg/iupdialog.html"><strong>IupDialog</strong></a> function. 
</p>

<p>As said before, callbacks are special functions defined by the programmer and 
called by IUP when an event needs to be handled. To create a callback, the programmer 
must declare a function and put inside its body anything that he/she wants the 
application to do when the event occurs. After that, it is necessary to inform IUP 
that new function is, in fact, a callback. That is done calling the function 
<A href="../func/iupsetcallback.html"><strong>IupSetCallback</strong></a>. This 
call will inform IUP that our regular function btn_exit_cb is 
actually a callback that needs to be executed when our button is pressed. The
first parameter is our button Ihandle, followed by the name
of the callback and the name of the function to be called,
casted as Icallback. The names of the available callbacks can be found
at each control documentation. As attribute names, they are always written in upper 
case letters.</p>

<p>When executed, the application's dialog box will show up, and when the user presses the button, 
it displays a hello message and will close the application. It seems not a big deal, but with 
this small sample of code, we have covered the process of creating an IUP application, 
declare elements and callbacks, and also handle an event. From now on, we are going to see more from 
IUP controls and how to improve our application using different kinds of controls.
</p>

<p>In Lua we set the button action callback just like we set an attribute. So, 
there is no call to
<A href="../func/iupsetcallback.html"><strong>IupSetCallback</strong></a>. </p>

<h3>2.4 <a name="Adding_Layout_Elements">Adding Layout Elements</a></h3>

<p> Up until now we have just positioned our controls inside a vbox which, as told, aligns all controls
inside it vertically. This is just a small sample of the IUP's layout concept. IUP implements an 
abstract layout, in which the positioning of controls is done relatively instead of 
absolutely. For such, composition elements are necessary for composing the interface elements. 
They are boxes and fills invisible to the user, but they play an important part. When a 
dialog size changes, these containers expand or retract to adjust the positioning of the controls 
to the new situation allowing the dialog to adapt even if the resolution of the screen changes.
That would come in hand if you port your application to another system with a lower resolution,
for example. Main composition elements are vertical boxes (vbox), horizontal boxes (hbox) 
and filling (fill), among others. There is also a depth box (zbox), in which layers of elements can 
be created for the same dialog, and the elements in each layer are only visible when that given 
layer is active.
</p>

<p>To clarify the way abstract layout works, lets modify our example adding 
a label
to it.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code 
<span class="example_button">[in C] <a target="example2_4" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_4.c">example2_4.c</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_4.c">
<img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span> <span class="example_button">[in Lua] <a target="example2_4" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_4.lua">example2_4.lua</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_4.lua"><img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example2_4.c" id="2_4" name="example2_4" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" style="height: 37em">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img src="example2_4.png"></p>

<p>Note that there is a new <strong>label</strong> declaration and this new element 
appears inside our vbox as the top element.
That means it will be displayed above <strong>button</strong>, and that's all. Our example now has two
different elements and is disposed vertically one above the other. An interesting 
exercise would be to change the code above and use an hbox to see what happens.</p>

<p>In Lua we used a simpler way to associate a callback, using a Lua syntax 
sugar "button:exit_cb()". But to use this syntax, the button element must exist 
before the callback declaration, so we also moved its code to after the button 
construction.</p>

<h3>2.5 <a name="Improving_the_Layout">Improving the Layout</a></h3>

<p>Now that you understand the basics of abstract layout, let us present three attributes available to both vboxes and hboxes. They are: 
ALIGNMENT, GAP and MARGIN.</p>
<p>ALIGNMENT defines the horizontal or vertical alignment of elements inside the 
box. If you are using a vbox, it will be an horizontal alignment, or if you are 
using an hbox, it will be a vertical alignment. Its values can be "ALEFT", 
"ACENTER" or "ARIGHT" for horizontal alignment, and "ATOP", "ACENTER" or 
"ABOTTOM" for vertical alignment. The default value is "ALEFT" and "ATOP".</p>

<p>GAP defines a space in pixels between every element inside the box. If you are using a vbox, it will be
a vertical space, or if you are using a hbox, it will be a horizontal space. The default value for GAP is 0 (which means no 
space between elements).</p>

<p>MARGIN defines a margin in pixels. Its value has the format "widthxheight", in which width and height are integer values corresponding to the horizontal and vertical margins, respectively. 
Its default value is "0x0" (means no margin).</p>

<p>Let's see how our layout responds to these three attributes.</p>

<p>Notice that the Lua version of our example has only a few changes. We just add a line with the label creation and inserted it into the vbox a little further.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code 
<span class="example_button">[in C] <a target="example2_5" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_5.c">example2_5.c</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_5.c">
<img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span> <span class="example_button">[in Lua] <a target="example2_5" href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_5.lua">example2_5.lua</a> <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example2_5.lua"><img alt="" src="download.png"></a></span></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example2_5.c" id="2_5" name="example2_5" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img src="example2_5.png"></p>

<p>After creating the vbox, we have added three lines that set those attributes to 
values different than the default values. The result is much pleasanter to see. 
Although it is still not quite as the first example, which uses a pre-defined 
dialog. Can you figure out which attributes we need to set in order to obtain a more 
closer appearance?</p>
