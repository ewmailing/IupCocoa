<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><a name="Introduction"></a>Hello and welcome to the IUP Tutorial.
Our goal is to provide a walkthrough guide to develop IUP
applications focused in people that haven't used IUP before. First
of all it is necessary to describe what IUP is and how it can help you
develop your application. IUP stands for "Interface com Usuário
Portátil" in Portuguese, which translates to "Portable User Interface". It is a
multi-platform toolkit for building graphical user interfaces,
offering a simple API in two main languages C/C++ and Lua, and
its purpose is to allow the user interface source code of an application to be compiled in
different systems without any modification. Supported systems
include: GTK+, Motif and Windows. As main advantages, IUP offers:
high performance since it uses native interface
elements, and a fast learning curve due to the simplicity of its API.
Also, IUP uses an abstract layout model based on the boxes-and-glue
paradigm from the TeX text editor making the dialog creation task
more flexible and independent from the graphics system resolution. 
</p>
<p>IUP has 3 concepts that any user has to understand:
<strong>Elements</strong>, <strong>Attributes</strong> and <strong>Callbacks</strong>. 
</p>
<p><strong>Elements</strong> are every kind of interface element present in the
application. IUP contains several user interface elements. The
library's main characteristic is the use of native elements.
This means that the drawing and management of a button or text box is
done by the native interface system, not by IUP. This makes the
application's appearance more similar to other applications in
that system. On the other hand, the application's appearance can
vary from one system to another. Besides, some additional controls are drawn by IUP, 
and are independent from the native system. Dialogs are special 
elements that represent every window created by IUP. Any application that
uses IUP will be composed by one or more dialogs. Every dialog can contains one 
or more controls inside. 
</p>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong> are used to change or consult properties of 
elements.
Each element has a set of attributes that affects its behavior or its appearance. 
Each
attribute may work differently for each elements, but usually attributes with 
the same name work the same. Attribute names are
always upper case. But attribute
values like &quot;YES&quot;, &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;TOP&quot;, are
case insensitive, so &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;top&quot;,
and other variations will work. 
</p>
<p><strong>Callbacks</strong> are functions which notify the application that 
some user interface event occurred. Usually callbacks will be called only when 
the user interacts with the application elements. If the application register 
the callback function, then the function will be called every time the event 
occurs.</p>
<p>All we have seen until now is a short summary of what is
behind the IUP toolkit and concepts that the developer needs to be
familiarized with when programming with IUP. From now on, we are going to
present how to build an IUP application from the most simple example
possible to a complex and full of different resources application.
