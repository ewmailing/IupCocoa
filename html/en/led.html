<h2 align="center" style="text-align:center">LED</h2>
<p>LED is a dialog-specification language whose purpose is not to be a complete 
programming language, but rather to make dialog specification simpler than in C. </p>
<p>In LED, attributes and expressions follow this form:</p>
<p>elem = element[<b>attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2,</b>...](...expression...)</p>
<p>The names of the elements must not contain the “iup” prefix. Attribute values 
are always interpreted as strings, but they need to be in quotes (“…”) only when 
they include spaces. The “IUP_” prefix must not be added to the names of the 
attributes and predefined values. Expressions contain parameters for creating 
the element.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>In LED there is no distinction between upper and lower case, except for 
attribute names.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>
Also<u1:p> there is no NULL definition, so there is no optional parameters, in 
arrays at least one parameter must exist .</u1:p></p>
<p>The <a href="func/iupload.html">IupLoad</a> function can parse a text file and create 
the IUP elements defined in it. Naturally, the same file cannot be loaded more 
than once, because the elements would be created again. The file parse 
does not map the elements to the native system.</p>
<p>The LED files are dynamically loaded and must be packaged together with the 
application’s executable. However, this often becomes an inconvenience. To deal 
with it, there is the 
<a href="ledc.html">LEDC</a> compiler that creates a C module from the LED 
contents. </p>
<p>To simply view a LED file objects use the LED Viewer application called 
	<a href="executables.html">IupView</a>, in the applications included in the distribution.
  <u1:p>Pre-compiled binaries are available at the <a href="download.html">Download</a>.</u1:p></p>
