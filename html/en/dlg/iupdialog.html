<h2>IupDialog</h2>
<p>Creates a dialog element. It manages user interaction with the interface 
elements. For any interface element to be shown, it must be encapsulated in a 
dialog.</p>
  
<h3><a name="Creation">Creation</a></h3>

<pre>Ihandle* IupDialog(Ihandle *<strong>child</strong>); <em>[in C]</em>
iup.dialog{<strong>child</strong>: ihandle} -&gt; (<strong>elem</strong>: ihandle) <em>[in Lua]</em>
dialog(<strong>child</strong>) <em>[in LED]</em></pre>

<p><strong>child</strong>: Identifier of an interface element. The dialog has 
only one child. It can be NULL (nil in Lua), not optional in LED.</p>
<p><u>Returns:</u> the identifier of the created element, or NULL if an error 
occurs.</p>

<h4>Common</h4>
<p><b>BACKGROUND </b>(<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): Dialog background 
color or image. Can be a non inheritable alternative to BGCOLOR or can be the 
name of an image to be tiled on the background. <u1:p></u1:p>

(since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>BORDER</strong> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>) (creation 
only): Shows a resize border around the dialog. Default: &quot;YES&quot;. BORDER=NO is 
useful only when RESIZE=NO, MAXBOX=NO, MINBOX=NO, MENUBOX=NO and TITLE=NULL, if 
any of these are defined there will be always some border.</p>
<p><strong>BORDERSIZE</strong> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>) (read 
only): returns the border size. (since 3.18)</p>
<p><strong>CHILDOFFSET</strong>: Allow to specify a position offset for the 
child. Available for native containers only. It will not affect the natural 
size, and allows to position controls outside the client area. Format &quot;<em>dx</em>x<em>dy</em>&quot;,
  where <em>dx</em> and <em>dy</em> are integer values corresponding to the horizontal and vertical 
offsets, respectively, in pixels. Default: 0x0. (since 3.14)</p>

but does not affects the controls inside the dialog. (since 3.13)</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_size.html">SIZE</a> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): 
Dialog’s size. Additionally the following values can also be defined for width 
and/or height: </p>
<ul>

	screen's width (or height)</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">The dialog <strong>Natural</strong> size is only considered when 
the <strong>User</strong> size is not defined or when it is bigger than the
<strong>Current</strong> size. This behavior is different from a control that 
goes inside the dialog. Because of that, when SIZE or RASTERSIZE are set (changing the 
<strong>User</strong> size), the 
<strong>Current</strong> size is internally reset to 0x0, so the the <strong>Natural</strong> size 
can be considered when re-computing the <strong>Current</strong> size of the dialog.</p>
<p class="info">Values set at SIZE or RASTERSIZE attributes of a dialog are always 
accepted, regardless of the minimum size required by its children. For a dialog 
to have the minimum necessary size to fit all elements contained in it, simply 
define SIZE or RASTERSIZE to NULL. Also if you set SIZE or RASTERSIZE to be used 
as the initial size of the dialog, its contents will be limited to this size as 
the minimum size, if you do not want that, then after showing the dialog reset 
this size to NULL so the dialog can be resized to smaller values. But notice 
that its contents will still be limited by the <strong>Natural</strong> size, to 
also remove that limitation set SHRINK=YES. To only change the <strong>User</strong> 
size in pixels, without resetting the <strong>Current</strong> size, set the 
USERSIZE attribute (since 3.12).</p>
<p class="info">Notice that the dialog size includes its decoration (it is the
<strong>Window</strong> size), the area available for controls are returned by 
the dialog

dialogs, just like when the dialog is made modal. (since 3.21)</font></p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_title.html">TITLE</a> (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): 
Dialog’s title. Default: NULL. If you want to remove the title bar you must also 
set MENUBOX=NO, MAXBOX=NO and MINBOX=NO, before map. But in Motif and GTK it 
will hide it only if RESIZE=NO also.</p>

are supported.&nbsp;</p>


<h4>Exclusive</h4>
<p><strong>DEFAULTENTER</strong>:&nbsp; Name of the button activated when the 
user press Enter when focus is in another control of the dialog. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">
IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
associate a button to a name. </p>
<p><strong>DEFAULTESC</strong>: Name of the button activated when the user press 
Esc when focus is in another control of the dialog. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">
IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
associate a button to a name.</p>
<p><strong>DIALOGFRAME</strong>: Set the common decorations for modal dialogs. 
This means RESIZE=NO, MINBOX=NO and MAXBOX=NO. In Windows, if the PARENTDIALOG 
is defined then the MENUBOX is also removed, but the Close button remains.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_icon.html">ICON</a>: Dialog’s icon. The Windows SDK 
  recommends that cursors and icons should be implemented as resources rather 
  than created at run time. </p>
<p><strong>FULLSCREEN: </strong>Makes the dialog occupy the whole screen over 
any system bars in the main monitor. All dialog details, such as title bar, 
borders, maximize button, etc, are removed. Possible values: YES, NO. In Motif 
you may have to click in the dialog to set its focus.
      In Motif if set to YES when the dialog is hidden, then it can not be 
changed after it is visible.</p>

<p><strong>MAXBOX</strong> (creation only): Requires a maximize button from the 
window manager. If RESIZE=NO then MAXBOX will be set to NO. Default: YES. In 
Motif the decorations are controlled by the Window Manager and may not be 
possible to be changed from IUP. In Windows MAXBOX is hidden only if MINBOX is 
hidden as well, or else it will be just disabled.</p>
<p><strong>MAXSIZE</strong>: Maximum size for the dialog in raster units 
(pixels). The windowing system will not be able to change the size beyond this 
limit. Default: 65535x65535. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>MENU</strong>: Name of a menu. Associates a menu to the dialog as a 
menu bar. The previous menu, if any, is unmapped. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">
IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
associate a menu to a name. See also <a href="../elem/iupmenu.html">IupMenu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MENUBOX</strong> (creation only): Requires a system menu box from the 
window manager. If hidden will also remove the Close button. Default: YES. In 
Motif the decorations are controlled by the Window Manager and may not be 
possible to be changed from IUP. In Windows if hidden will hide also MAXBOX and 
MINBOX.</p>
<p><strong>MINBOX</strong> (creation only): Requires a minimize button from the 
window manager. Default: YES. In Motif the decorations are controlled by the 
Window Manager and may not be possible to be changed from IUP. In Windows MINBOX 
is hidden only if MAXBOX is hidden as well, or else it will be just disabled.</p>
<p><strong>MINSIZE</strong>: Minimum size for the dialog in raster units 
(pixels). The windowing system will not be able to change the size beyond this 
limit. Default: 1x1. Some systems define a very minimum size greater than this, 
for instance in Windows the horizontal minimum size includes the window 
decoration buttons. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>MODAL</strong> (read-only): Returns the popup state. It is &quot;YES&quot; if 
the dialog was shown using <strong>IupPopup</strong>. It is &quot;NO&quot; if 
<strong>IupShow</strong> was used or it is not 
visible. At the first time the dialog is shown, MODAL is not set yet when 
SHOW_CB is called. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>NATIVEPARENT</strong> (creation only): Native handle of a dialog to 
be used as parent. Used only if PARENTDIALOG is not defined.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_parentdialog.html">PARENTDIALOG</a> (creation only): 
Name of a dialog to be used as parent. </p>
<p><a name="PLACEMENT"><strong>PLACEMENT</strong></a>: Changes how the dialog 
will be shown. Values: &quot;FULL&quot;, &quot;MAXIMIZED&quot;, &quot;MINIMIZED&quot; and &quot;NORMAL&quot;. Default: 
NORMAL. After <strong>IupShow</strong>/<strong>IupPopup</strong> the attribute 
is set back to &quot;NORMAL&quot;. FULL is similar to FULLSCREEN but only the dialog 
client area covers the screen area, menu and decorations will be there but out 
of the screen. In UNIX there is a chance that the placement won't work 
correctly, that depends on the Window Manager. In Windows, the SHOWNOACTIVE 
attribute can be set to Yes to avoid to make the window active (since 3.15). In 
Windows, the SHOWMINIMIZENEXT attribute can be set to Yes to activate the next 
top-level window in the Z order when minimizing (since 3.15).</p>
<p><strong>RESIZE</strong> (creation only): Allows interactively changing the 
dialog’s size. Default: YES. If RESIZE=NO then MAXBOX will be set to NO. In Motif the decorations are controlled by the 
Window Manager and may not be possible to be changed from IUP.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_shrink.html">SHRINK</a>: Allows changing the elements’ 
distribution when the dialog is smaller than the minimum size. Default: NO.</p>
<p><strong>STARTFOCUS</strong>: Name of the element that must receive the focus 
right after the dialog is shown using <strong>IupShow</strong> or <strong>
IupPopup</strong>. If not defined then the first control than can receive the 
focus is selected (same effect of calling
<a href="../func/iupnextfield.html">IupNextField</a> for the dialog). Updated 
after SHOW_CB is called and only if the focus was not changed during the 
callback.</p>
<h4>Exclusive [System Dependent]</h4>

<p><strong>HWND</strong> [Windows Only] (<font size="3">non inheritable, 
read-only</font>): Returns the Windows Window handle. Available in the Windows 
driver or in the GTK driver in Windows.</p>

<p><strong>SAVEUNDER</strong> [Windows and Motif Only] (creation only): When 
this attribute is true (YES), the dialog stores the original image of the 
desktop region it occupies (if the system has enough memory to store the image). 
In this case, when the dialog is closed or moved, a redrawing event is not 
generated for the windows that were shadowed by it. Its default value is YES if 
the dialog has a parent dialog (since 3.24). To 
save memory disable it for your main dialog. Not available in GTK.</p>
<p><strong>XWINDOW</strong> [UNIX Only] (<font size="3">non inheritable, 
read-only</font>): Returns the X-Windows Window (Drawable). Available in the 
Motif driver or in the GTK driver in UNIX.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Exclusive [Windows and GTK Only]</h4>
<p><strong>ACTIVEWINDOW</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (read-only): informs if 
the dialog is the active window (the window with focus). Can be Yes or No. 
(since 3.4)</p>

<p><font SIZE="3">
	<strong>CUSTOMFRAME</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (non inheritable): 
allows the application to customize the dialog frame elements (the title and its 
buttons) by using IUP controls for its elements like caption, minimize button, 
maximize button, and close buttons. The application is responsible for leaving 
space for the borders. One drawback is that menu bars will not work. For the 
dialog to be able to be moved an <strong>IupLabel</strong> or an <strong>
IupCanvas</strong> must be at the top of the dialog and must have the NAME 
attribute set to CUSTOMFRAMECAPTION (since 3.22). Custom frames are supported 
only in GTK version 3.10, so for older GTK versions we have to simulate the 
support by removing all dialog decorations. (since 3.18) (renamed in 3.22) (GTK 
support since 3.22)</font></p>

<p><strong>DROPFILESTARGET</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (<font SIZE="3">non inheritable</font>): 
Enable or disable the drop of files. Default: NO, but if DROPFILES_CB is 
defined when the element is mapped then it will be automatically enabled.</p>

<p><strong>MAXIMIZED</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (read-only): indicates if the 
dialog is maximized. Can be YES or NO. (since 3.12)</p>
<p><strong>MINIMIZED</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (read-only): indicates if the 
dialog is minimized. Can be YES or NO. (since 3.15)</p>
<p><strong>OPACITY</strong> [Windows and GTK Only]: sets the dialog transparency 
alpha value. Valid values range from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (opaque). 
In Windows must be set before map so the native window would be properly 
initialized when mapped (since 3.16). (GTK 2.12)</p>

<p><strong>OPACITYIMAGE</strong> [Windows and GTK Only]: sets a transparent 
image as the dialog shape so it is possible to create a non rectangle window. In 
Windows must be set before map so the native window would be properly 
initialized when mapped (since 3.16). In GTK the shape works only as a bitmap 
mask, to view a color image must also use a label. (GTK 2.12) 
(since 3.12)</p>

<p><strong>TOPMOST</strong> [Windows and GTK Only]:&nbsp; puts the dialog always 
in front of all other dialogs in all applications. Default: NO.</p>

<h4>Exclusive [Windows Only]</h4>
<p><strong>BRINGFRONT</strong> [Windows Only] (write-only): makes the dialog the 
foreground window. Use &quot;YES&quot; to activate it. Useful for multithreaded 
applications.</p>
<p><strong>COMPOSITED</strong> [Windows Only] (creation only): controls if the 
window will have an automatic double buffer for all children. Default is &quot;NO&quot;. 
In Windows Vista it is NOT working as expected.</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_control.html">CONTROL</a> [Windows Only] (creation 
only): Embeds the dialog inside another window.</p>
<p>
<font SIZE="3">
	<strong>CUSTOMFRAMEDRAW</strong> [Windows Only] (non 
inheritable): allows the application to customize the dialog frame elements (the 
title and its buttons) by drawing 
them with the CUSTOMFRAMEDRAW_CB callback. Can be Yes or No. The Window client area 
is expanded to include the whole window. Notice that the dialog attributes like 
BORDER, RESIZE, MAXBOX, MINBOX and TITLE must still be defined. But maximize, 
minimize and close buttons must be manually implemented in the BUTTON_CB 
callback. One drawback is that 
menu bars will not work. (since 3.18) (renamed in 3.22)</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="3">
	<strong>CUSTOMFRAMECAPTIONHEIGHT</strong> [Windows Only] (non 
inheritable): height of the caption area. If not defined it will use the system 
size. (since 3.18) (renamed in 3.22)</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="3">
	<strong>CUSTOMFRAMECAPTIONLIMITS</strong> [Windows Only] (non 
inheritable): limits of the caption area at left and at right. The caption area 
is always expanded inside the limits when the dialog is resized. Format is &quot;left:right&quot; 
or in C &quot;%d:%d&quot;. Default: &quot;0:0&quot;. This will allow the dialog to be moved by the 
system when the user click and drag the caption area. If not defined but 
CUSTOMFRAMECAPTION is defined, then it will use the caption element horizontal 
position and size for the limits (since 3.22). (since 3.18)</font></p>
<p><strong>HELPBUTTON</strong> [Windows Only] (creation only): Inserts a help 
button in the same place of the maximize button. It can only be used for dialogs 
without the minimize and maximize buttons, and with the menu box. For the next 
interaction of the user with a control in the dialog, the callback&nbsp; 
	<a href="../call/iup_help_cb.html">HELP_CB</a> will be called instead of the 
control defined ACTION callback. Possible values: YES, NO. Default: NO.</p>
<p><strong>TOOLBOX</strong> [Windows Only] (creation only): makes the dialog 
look like a toolbox with a smaller title bar. It is only valid if the PARENTDIALOG or NATIVEPARENT 
attribute is also defined. Default: NO.</p>
      
<h4>Exclusive [GTK Only]</h4>
<p><strong>DIALOGHINT</strong> [GTK Only] (creation-only): if enabled sets the window type 
hint to a dialog hint.</p>
      
<p><strong>HIDETITLEBAR</strong> [GTK Only]<font SIZE="3">
	(non inheritable): hides the title bar with al its elements. (since 3.20) 
(GTK 3.10)</font></p>

<h4>Exclusive Taskbar and Tray/Status Area [Windows and GTK Only]</h4>
<p><strong>HIDETASKBAR</strong> [Windows and GTK Only] (write-only): Action 
attribute that when set to &quot;YES&quot;, hides the dialog, but does not decrement the 
visible dialog count, does not call SHOW_CB and does not mark the dialog as 
hidden inside IUP. It is usually used to hide the dialog and keep the tray icon 
working without closing the main loop. It has the same effect as setting 
LOCKLOOP=Yes and normally hiding the dialog. IMPORTANT:
<font SIZE="3">when you hide using HIDETASKBAR, you must show using HIDETASKBAR 
also. </font>Possible values: YES, NO. </p>

<p><strong>TASKBARPROGRESS</strong> [Windows Only] (write-only): this 
functionality enables the use of progress bar on a taskbar button (Windows 7 or 
earlier version) (Available only for Visual C++ 10 and above). Default: NO (since 3.10).</p>
      
<p><strong>TASKBARPROGRESSSTATE</strong> [Windows Only] (write-only): sets the 
type and state of the progress indicator displayed on a taskbar button. Possible 
values: NORMAL (a green bar), PAUSED (a yellow bar), ERROR (a red bar), 
INDETERMINATE (a green marquee) and NOPROGRESS (no bar). Default: NORMAL (since 
3.10).</p>
<p><strong>TASKBARPROGRESSVALUE</strong> [Windows Only] (write-only): updates a 
progress bar hosted in a taskbar button to show the specific percentage 
completed of the full operation. The value must be between 0 and 100 (since 3.10).</p>

<p><b>TRAY</b> [Windows and GTK Only]: When set to &quot;YES&quot;, displays an icon on 
the system tray. (GTK 2.10)</p>
<p><b>TRAYIMAGE</b> [Windows and GTK Only]: Name of a IUP image to be used as 
the tray icon. The Windows SDK 
  recommends that cursors and icons should be implemented as resources rather 
  than created at run time. (GTK 2.10)</p>
<p><b>TRAYTIP</b> [Windows and GTK Only]: Tray icon's tooltip text. (GTK 2.10)</p>
<p><b>TRAYTIPMARKUP</b> [GTK Only]: allows the tip string to contains Pango markup 
commands. Can be &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;. Default: &quot;NO&quot;. 
Must be set before setting the TRAYTIP attribute. (GTK 2.16) (since 3.6)</p>
<p><strong><b>TRAY</b>TIPBALLOON</strong> [Windows Only]:
  The tip window will have the appearance of a cartoon &quot;balloon&quot; with rounded

  the tip can also has a pre-defined icon in the title area. Must be set before 
setting the TRAYTIP attribute. (since 3.6) </p>
<p class="info">Values can be:<br>&quot;0&quot; - No icon (default)<br>
    &quot;1&quot; - Info icon <br>
    &quot;2&quot; - Warning icon<br>

<h3><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h3>

<p>Do not associate an <strong>IupDialog</strong> with the native &quot;dialog&quot; 
nomenclature in Windows, GTK or Motif. 
<strong>IupDialog</strong> use native standard windows in all drivers.</p>
<p>Except for the menu, all other elements must be inside a dialog to interact 
with the user. Therefore, an interface element will only be visible if its 
dialog is also visible.</p>
<p>The order of callback calling is system dependent. For instance, the 
RESIZE_CB and the SHOW_CB are called in a different order in Win32 and in 
X-Windows when the dialog is shown for the first time.</p>
<p>In Windows, when all decorations are removed the window icon is not displayed 
on the task bar, when minimized a small rectangular window will be positioned 
above the task bar on the bottom left corner of the desktop.</p>
<h4>Windows MDI</h4>
<p>The MDI support is composed of 3 components: the MDI frame window 
(IupDialog), the MDI client window (IupCanvas) and the MDI children (IupDialog). 
Although the MDI client is a IupCanvas it is not used directly by the 
application, but it must be created and included in the dialog that will be the 
MDI frame, other controls can also be available in the same dialog, like buttons 
and other canvases composing toolbars and status area. The following picture 
illustrates the e components:</p>
