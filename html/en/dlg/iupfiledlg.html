<h2>IupFileDlg</h2>
  
  <p>
  Creates the File Dialog element. It is a predefined dialog for selecting files or a directory. The dialog can be 
  shown with the
  IupPopup function only.</p>

<h3><a name="Creation">Creation</a></h3>
  
  <pre>Ihandle* IupFileDlg(void); [in C]
iup.filedlg{} -&gt; (<strong>elem</strong>: ihandle) [in Lua]
filedlg() [in LED]</pre>

  
<p><u>Returns:</u> the identifier of the 
  created element, or NULL if an error occurs.</p>

<h3><a name="Attributes">Attributes</a></h3>
  
  <p><strong>ALLOWNEW</strong>:
  Indicates if non-existent file names are 
  accepted. If equals &quot;NO&quot; and the user specifies a non-existing file, 
  an alert dialog is shown. Default: if the dialog is of type &quot;OPEN&quot;, default is &quot;NO&quot;; if the dialog is of type &quot;SAVE&quot;, default is &quot;YES&quot;. 
  Not used when DIALOGTYPE=DIR.</p>
  
  <p><strong>DIALOGTYPE</strong>:
  Type of dialog (Open, Save or  Directory).
    Can have values &quot;OPEN&quot;, &quot;SAVE&quot; or &quot;DIR&quot;. Default: &quot;OPEN&quot;. </p>
    
  <blockquote>
  
  <p>In Windows, when DIALOGTYPE=DIR the dialog shown is not the same dialog for 
  OPEN and SAVE, this new dialog does not have the Help button neither filters. 
	Also this new dialog needs CoInitializeEx with COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED 
	(done in <strong>IupOpen</strong>), if the COM library was initialized with 
	COINIT_MULTITHREADED prior to <strong>IupOpen</strong> then the new dialog 
	will have limited functionality. In 
  Motif or GTK the dialog is the same, but it only allows the user to select a 
  directory.&nbsp;</p>
    
  </blockquote>
    
  <p><strong>DIRECTORY</strong>: Initial directory. When consulted after the 
	dialog is closed and the user pressed the OK button, it will contain the 
	directory of the selected file. When set the last separator does not need to 
  be specified, but when get the returned value will always contains the last 
  separator.</p>
  <blockquote>
    
  <p>In Motif or GTK, if not defined, the dialog opens in the current directory. </p>
    
  <p>In Windows, if not defined and the application has used the dialog in the 
	past, the path most recently used is selected as the initial directory. 
	However, if an application is not run for a long time, its saved selected 
	path is discarded. Also if not defined and the current directory contains 
	any files of the specified filter types, the initial directory is the 
	current directory. Otherwise, the initial directory is the &quot;My Documents&quot; 
	directory of the current user. Otherwise, the initial directory is the 
	Desktop folder.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>EXTFILTER</strong> [Windows  and GTK Only]: Defines several file filters. It has 
  priority over FILTERINFO and FILTER. Must be a text with the format &quot;FilterInfo1|Filter1|FilterInfo2|Filter2|...&quot;. 
  The list ends with character '|'.
  Example: &quot;Text files|*.txt;*.doc|Image files|*.gif;*.jpg;*.bmp|&quot;. In 
  GTK there is no way how to overwrite the filters, so it is recommended to 
  always add a less restrictive filter to the filter list, for example &quot;All 
	Files|*.*&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>EXTDEFAULT</strong>: default extension to be used if selected file 
does not have an extension. The inspected extension will consider to have the 
same number of characters of the default extension. It must NOT include the 
period &quot;.&quot;. (since 3.18)</p>
  <p><strong>FILE</strong>:
  Name of the file initially shown in the 
  &quot;File Name&quot; field in the dialog. If contains a full path, then it is used 
  as the initial directory and <strong style="font-weight: 400">DIRECTORY</strong> is ignored.</p>
  <p><strong>FILEEXIST</strong> (read-only):
  Indicates if the file defined by the FILE attribute exists or not.
  It is only valid if the user has pressed OK in the dialog. Not set when 
  DIALOGTYPE=DIR or <strong style="font-weight: 400">MULTIPLEFILES=YES</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>FILTER</strong>:
  String containing a list of file filters separated by ';' without spaces. Example: &quot;*.C;*.LED;test.*&quot;. 
  In Motif only the first filter is used. </p>
  <p><strong>FILTERINFO</strong> [Windows  and GTK Only]: Filter's description. If not defined the filter itself will be used as its 
  description.</p>
  
  <p><strong>FILTERUSED</strong> [Windows  and GTK Only]: the index of the filter in 
    EXTFILTER to use starting at 1. It returns the selection made by the user. 
  Set only if EXTFILTER is defined.</p>
    
  <p><strong>MULTIPLEFILES</strong>: Allows the user to select multiple 
    files when DIALOGTYPE=OPEN.&nbsp;Can be &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Default &quot;No&quot;.</p>
  
  <p><strong>NOCHANGEDIR</strong>:&nbsp;
  Indicates if the current working directory 
  must be restored after the user navigation. Default: &quot;YES&quot;.</p>
  <p><strong>NOOVERWRITEPROMPT</strong>: do not prompt to overwrite an existent file when 
  in
  &quot;SAVE&quot; dialog. Default is
  &quot;NO&quot;, i.e. prompt before overwrite.&nbsp; (GTK 2.8)</p>
  <p><strong><a href="../attrib/iup_parentdialog.html">PARENTDIALOG</a></strong>:
  Makes the dialog be treated as a child of the specified 
  dialog.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWEDITBOX</strong> [Windows Only]: Show an edit box in a dialog 
selection dialog. (since 3.20)</p>
  
  <p><b>SHOWHIDDEN</b>: Show hidden files. Default: NO. (since 3.0) (GTK 2.6)</p>
    
  <p><strong>SHOWPREVIEW</strong>:  A preview area is shown inside the file dialog.
    Can have values &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;. Default: &quot;NO&quot;. In Windows, you must link with the 
    &quot;iup.rc&quot; resource file so the preview area can be enabled (not 
    necessary if using &quot;iup.dll&quot;). Valid only if the FILE_CB callback 
	is 
  defined, use it to retrieve the file name and the necessary attributes to 
	paint the preview area. (in Motif since 3.0)</p>
    
  <blockquote>
  
  <p>Read only attributes that are valid inside the FILE_CB callback 
  when status=&quot;PAINT&quot;:<br>
	<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PREVIEWDC</strong>: Returns the Device 
    Context (HDC in Windows and GC in UNIX)<br>
	<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PREVIEWWIDTH </strong>and <strong>PREVIEWHEIGHT</strong>: 
	Returns the width and the height of the client rectangle for the preview area.<br>
	<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Also the attributes WID, HWND, XWINDOW and XDISPLAY are valid and are 
	relative to the preview area.</p>
	<p>If the attribute PREVIEWGLCANVAS is defined then it is used as the name 
	of an existent <strong>IupGLCanvas</strong> control to be mapped internally to the preview 
	canvas. Notice that this is not a fully implemented <strong>IupGLCanvas</strong> that 
	inherits from <strong>IupCanvas</strong>. This does the minimum necessary so you can use 
	<strong>IupGLCanvas</strong> auxiliary functions for the preview canvas and call OpenGL 
	functions. No <strong>IupCanvas</strong> attributes or callbacks are available. (since 3.0)</p>
    
  </blockquote>
    
  <p><strong>STATUS</strong> (read-only):
  Indicates the status of the selection made:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
		<p>&quot;1&quot;:
    New file.<br>
		&quot;0&quot;:
    Normal, existing file or directory.<br>
		&quot;-1&quot;:
    Operation cancelled.</p>
</blockquote>
  
  <p><strong><a href="../attrib/iup_title.html">TITLE</a></strong>:
  Dialog's title.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VALUE</strong> (read-only): Name of the selected file(s), or NULL 
  if no file was selected. If FILE is not defined this is used as the initial 
  value. When MULTIPLEFILES=Yes it contains the path (but NOT the same value 
  returned in DIRECTORY, it does not contains the last separator) and several file names 
  separated by the '|' character. The file list ends with character '|'. BUT 
  when the user selects just one file, the directory and the file are not 
  separated by '|'. For example:</p>
    
<pre>&quot;/tecgraf/iup/test|a.txt|b.txt|c.txt|&quot; (MULTIPLEFILES=Yes and more than one file is selected)
&quot;/tecgraf/iup/test/a.txt&quot; (only one file is selected)</pre>
  
<p><strong>MULTIVALUECOUNT</strong>(read-only): number of returned values when MULTIPLEFILES=Yes. 
It always includes the path, so if only 1 file is selected its value is 2. (Since 3.14)</p>
<p><strong>MULTIVALUE</strong><em><strong>id</strong></em> (read-only): almost the same 
sequence returned in VALUE when MULTIPLEFILES=Yes but split in several 
attributes. VALUE0 contains the path (same value returned in DIRECTORY), and VALUE1,VALUE2,... 
contains each file name without the path. (Since 3.14)</p>
<p><strong>MULTIVALUEPATH</strong>: force a full path in MULTIVALUE and VALUE attributes 
when MULTIPLEFILES=Yes (id=0 will still contains the path of the first file). In Windows and Motif, only 
files in the same folder may be selected, but in GTK when using the &quot;Recent 
Files&quot; files from different folders can be selected. (since 3.20)</p>
  

<h3><a name="Callbacks">Callbacks</a></h3>
  
  <p><strong>FILE_CB</strong>:  Action generated when a file is selected. 
  Not called when DIALOGTYPE=DIR. When MULTIPLEFILES=YES it is called only for 
  one file. Can be used with SHOWPREVIEW=NO also. (Windows only in 2.x)</p>
    
    <pre>int function(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, const char* <strong>file_name</strong>, const char* <strong>status</strong>); [in C]<br>elem:file_cb(<strong>file_name</strong>, <strong>status</strong>: string) -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]</pre>
    <p class="info"><strong>ih</strong>:
  identifier of the element that activated the 
  event.<br>
    <strong>file_name</strong>: name of the file selected.<br>
    <strong>status</strong>: describes the  action. Can be:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;INIT&quot; - when the dialog has started. file_name is NULL.</li>
        <li>&quot;FINISH&quot; - when the dialog is closed. file_name is NULL.</li>
		  <li>&quot;SELECT&quot; - a file has been selected.</li>
		<li>&quot;OTHER&quot; - an invalid file or a directory is selected. file_name is 
		the one selected. (Since 3.0)</li>
        <li>&quot;OK&quot; - the user pressed the OK button. If returns 
        IUP_IGNORE, the action is refused and the dialog is not closed, if 
		returns IUP_CONTINUE does the same, but if the FILE 
		  attribute is defined the current filename is updated (since 3.8).</li>
        <li>&quot;PAINT&quot; - the preview area must be redrawn.<br>Used only when SHOWPREVIEW=YES. 
        If an invalid file or a directory is selected, file_name is NULL.</li>
		  <li>&quot;FILTER&quot; - when a filter is changed. (Windows Only) (since 3.6)<br>
		  FILTERUSED attribute will be updated to reflect the change. If returns 
		  IUP_CONTINUE, the FILE 
		  attribute if defined will update the current filename.</li>

<h3><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h3>
  
  <p>The <b>IupFileDlg</b> is a native pre-defined dialog that is not altered by 
  <a href="../func/iupsetlanguage.html">IupSetLanguage</a>.</p>
  <p>
  To show the dialog, use function <a href="../func/iuppopup.html">IupPopup</a>. In Lua, use the popup function.</p>
<p>The dialog is mapped only inside <b>IupPopup</b>, <b>IupMap</b> does nothing.</p>
<p>
  The <a href="iupgetfile.html">
  IupGetFile</a> function simply creates and popup a <strong>IupFileDlg</strong>.</p>
<p>
  In Windows, the FILE and the DIRECTORY attributes also accept strings containing 
  &quot;/&quot; as path separators, but the VALUE attribute will always return strings 
  using the &quot;\&quot; character.</p>
<p>In Windows, the dialog will be modal relative only to its parent or to the 
active dialog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows, when using UTF-8 strings (UTF8MODE=Yes), attributes that return file names are still 
using the current locale, because the standard file I/O functions, like fopen, 
use ANSI file names. To use UTF-8 filenames (that can be lately be converted to UTF-16) set the global attribute
<a href="../attrib/iup_globals.html#UTF8MODE">UTF8MODE_FILE</a> to Yes. In a 
specific case, the application can set before popup, and unset after, so for 
just that call will return in UTF-8.</p>
<p>When saving a file, the overwrite check is done before the FILE_CB callback 
is called with status=OK. If the application wants to add an extension to the 
file name inside the FILE_CB callback when status=OK, then it must manually 
check if the file with the extension exits and asks the user if the file should 
be replaced, if not then the callback can set the FILE attribute and returns 
IUP_CONTINUE, so the file dialog will remain open and the user will have an 
opportunity to change the file name now that it contains the extension.</p>
