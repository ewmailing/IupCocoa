<h2>IupMatrix Attributes<span class="style1"> (all non inheritable, with 
exceptions)</span></h2>
<h3><a name="General_Attributes">General Attributes</a></h3>
<p><strong><a name="CURSOR">CURSOR</a></strong>:
  Default cursor used by the matrix. The 
  default cursor is a symbol that looks like a cross. If you need to refer to this default cursor, use the name 
&quot;IupMatrixCrossCursor&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>DROPIMAGE</strong>: drop image name. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
	associate an image to a name. See also <a href="../elem/iupimage.html">IupImage</a>. 
By default an internal image will be used. (since 3.16) </p>
<p><strong><a name="FOCUS_CELL">FOCUSCELL</a></strong>:
  Defines the current cell. Two numbers in the &quot;<strong><em>L</em></strong>:<strong><em>C</em></strong>&quot; format, 
    &nbsp;(<strong><em>L</em></strong>&gt;0 and <strong><em>C</em></strong>&gt;0, a title cell can NOT be the current cell). Default: &quot;1:1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>FLAT</strong>: removes the 3D appearance from the matrix. (since 
3.25)</p>
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_flatscrollbar.html">FLATSCROLLBAR</a>: enable the flat 
scrollbars. Can be set only before map. SCROLLBAR is set to NO. Can be Yes,

  drawing the matrix. Default is NO.</p>
<p><strong><a name="HIDDENTEXTMARKS">HIDDENTEXTMARKS</a></strong>: when text is greater than cell space, it is 
normally cropped, but when set to YES a &quot;...&quot; mark will be added at the crop 
point to indicate that there is more text not visible. Default: NO. (since 3.1)</p>
<p><strong>HLCOLOR</strong>: the overlay 
color for the selected cells. Default: TXTHLCOLOR global attribute. If set to &quot;&quot; 
will only use the attenuation process. The color is composited using 
HLCOLORALPHA attribute as alpha value (default is 128). (since 3.16)</p>

  
<p><strong><a name="ORIGIN">ORIGIN</a></strong>: Scroll the visible area to the 
given cell. Returns the cell at the top-left corner. To scroll to a line or a 
column, use a value such as &quot;<strong><em>L</em></strong>:*&quot; or &quot;*:<strong><em>C</em></strong>&quot; (where
<em><strong>L</strong></em>&gt;0 and <strong><em>C</em></strong>&gt;0). L and C 
can not be a non scrollable cell either.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ORIGINOFFSET">ORIGINOFFSET</a></strong>: complements the 
ORIGIN attribute by specifying the drag offset of the top left cell. Returns the 
current value. Has the format &quot;X:Y&quot; or &quot;%d:%d&quot; in C. When 
changing this attribute must change also ORIGIN right after. (since 3.5)</p>
<p><strong><a name="READONLY">READONLY</a></strong>: disables the editing of all cells. EDITION_CB and 
VALUE_EDIT_CB will not be called anymore. The L:C attribute will still be able 
to change the cell value. (since 3.0)</p>

<p><strong>SHOWFILLVALUE</strong>: enable the display of the numeric percentage 
in the cell when TYPE* is FILL. Default: NO. (since 3.9)</p>
<p><strong>TOGGLECENTERED</strong>: center the toggle and use the cell value in 
place of TOGGLEVALUE<em>L:C</em>. No text will be drawn. (since 3.16)</p>
<p><strong>TOGGLEIMAGEON/TOGGLEIMAGEOFF</strong>: toggle image name. Use <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">IupSetHandle</a> or
	<a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html">IupSetAttributeHandle</a> to 
	associate an image to a name. See also <a href="../elem/iupimage.html">IupImage</a>. 
By default an internal image will be used. (since 3.16) </p>
<p><strong>TYPECOLORINACTIVE</strong>: when inactive the color of the cell for 
TYPE*=COLOR will be attenuated as everything else. Default: Yes. (since 3.19)</p>

  L and column 
  C.&nbsp;Values are in the format: &quot;linalign:colalign&quot;, where linalign can be 
&quot;ATOP&quot;, &quot;ACENTER&quot; or &quot;ABOTTOM&quot;, and colalign can be &quot;ALEFT&quot;, &quot;ACENTER&quot; or

interpreted as a color and a rectangle with the color is drawn inside the cell 
instead of the text (the FGCOLOR of the cell is ignored). When type is FILL the 
cell value is interpreted as percentage and a rectangle showing the percentage 
in the FGCOLOR is drawn like in <strong>IupGauge</strong> and <strong>
IupProgressBar</strong>. When type is IMAGE the cell value is interpreted as an 
image name, and if an image exist with that name is drawn (the name can NOT be

    selected following this priority: BGCOLORL:C, BGCOLORL:*, BGCOLOR*:C, and 
    last BGCOLOR.
    (L or C &gt;= 0) <br>
    Default BGCOLOR is the global attribute TXTBGCOLOR for cells and the parent's BGCOLOR for titles.<br>

    following this priority: FGCOLORL:C, FGCOLORL:*, FGCOLOR*:C, and last
    FGCOLOR. 
    (L or C &gt;= 0)<br>
Default FGCOLOR is the global attribute TXTFGCOLOR for cells or the global

    cells. The cell size is always calculated from the base FONT attribute. 
FONTSTYLE<i>L</i><strong>:</strong><i>C</i><strong> </strong>and FONTSIZE<i>L</i><strong>:</strong><i>C</i> can also be used to set FONT changing only the font style 
or size (since 
3.21).</p>
<p><strong><a name="FRAMECOLOR">FRAMECOLOR</a></strong>:
  Sets the color to be used in the frame lines. (inheritable)<br>
<strong>FRAMEVERTCOLOR<em>L:C</em></strong>: Color of the vertical right frame 
line of the cell. When not defined the FRAMEVERTCOLOR<em>*:C</em> is used. For a title column cell 
(col=0) defines 
right and left frames, except if FRAMETITLEVERTCOLOR<i>L</i><strong>:</strong><i>C</i>&nbsp; 
is defined. If value is &quot;BGCOLOR&quot; the frame line is not drawn.<br>

defined. If value is 
&quot;BGCOLOR&quot; the frame line is not drawn.<br>
<strong>FRAMEHORIZCOLOR<em>L:*</em></strong>: same as FRAMEHORIZCOLOR<em>L:C </em>
but for all the cells of the line L. When not defined the FRAMECOLOR is used. (since 3.5)<br>
<strong>FRAMETITLEHORIZCOLOR<em>0:C</em></strong>: color of the horizontal top 
frame line of the cell. When not defined the FRAMEHORIZCOLOR<em>0:C</em>&nbsp; 
is used. &quot;C&quot; can also be &quot;*&quot;. (since 3.22)</p>
<p><strong>FRAMETITLEHIGHLIGHT</strong>: by default the title cells will have a 
bright line at left and top to configure a raise appearance. Can be Yes or No. 
Default: Yes. (since 3.9)</p>
<p><strong>FRAMEBORDER</strong>: show a fixed border (non scrollable) of 1 pixel 
around the matrix visible area using FRAMECOLOR. It is drawn after the matrix 
cells are drawn. Drawn only when the scrollbars are visible, and only up to 
matrix total size. Default: No. (since 3.20)</p>
<p><strong>RESIZEMATRIXCOLOR</strong>: color used by the column resize feedback. 
Default: &quot;102 102 102&quot;. (Since 3.9)</p>
<p><strong>TOGGLEVALUE<i>L</i>:<i>C</i> </strong>: value of the toggle inside 
the cell. The toggle is shown only if the DROPCHECK_CB returns IUP_CONTINUE for 
the cell. When the toggle is interactively change the TOGGLEVALUE_CB callback is 
called. (Since 3.9) </p>
<p><strong><a name="VALUE">VALUE</a></strong>:
  Allows setting or verifying the value of the 
  current cell. Is the same as obtaining the current cell line and column from 
FOCUSCELL attribute, and then using them to access the &quot;L:C&quot; attribute. 
But when updated or retrieved during cell editing, the edit control will be 
updated or consulted instead of the matrix cell. When retrieved inside the 
EDITION_CB callback when mode is 0, then the return value is the new value 
  that will be updated in the cell.</p>

then the column of line titles is hidden.</p>
<p>If it is a regular column (n&gt;0), then if USETITLESIZE=YES, then it will use 
the width of the title of the column. Finally if the condition is not true or

line height.</p>
<p>If it is the title line (n=0), then if USETITLESIZE=YES or not in callback 
mode, it will search for the maximum height among the titles of all columns. 
Finally if the conditions are not true or the maximum height of the line is 0, 
then the line of column titles is hidden.</p>
<p>If it is a regular line (n&gt;0), then if USETITLESIZE=YES, then it will use the 
height of the title of the line. Finally if the condition is not true or the 
height of the title of the line is 0, then the default value HEIGHTDEF is used.</p>
<p><strong><a name="HEIGHTn">HEIGHTn</a></strong>: Height of line n in SIZE 
units, where n is the number of the line (n&gt;=0). If the height value is 0, the 
line will not be shown on the screen. It does not includes the decoration size 
occupied by the frame lines. The returned value is the actual computed size.</p>

the scrollbar. IMPORTANT: When 
  retrieved returns the current number of visible lines, not including the non 
scrollable lines. Default: &quot;3&quot;.</p>
<p><a name="NUMLIN_NOSCROLL"><strong>NUMLIN_NOSCROLL</strong></a>: Number of 
lines that are non scrollable, not counting the title line. Default: &quot;0&quot;. It does not affect the 
NUMLIN_VISIBLE attribute behavior nor Natural size computation. It will always 
use the first lines of the matrix. The cells appearance will be the same of 
ordinary cells, and they can also receive the focus and be edited.&nbsp; Must be 
less than the total number of lines. (since 3.5)</p>
<p><strong>NOSCROLLASTITLE</strong>: Non scrollable lines and columns to look 
and behave as title cells. Can be Yes or No. Default: No. (since 3.24)</p>
<h3><a name="Mark_Attributes">Mark Attributes</a></h3>
<p><strong>MARK<a name="MARKAREA">AREA</a></strong>:
  Defines if the area to be <strong>interactively</strong> 
  marked by the user must be continuous or not, valid only if MARKMULTIPLE=YES. Possible values: &quot;CONTINUOUS&quot; or &quot;NOT_CONTINUOUS&quot;. Default: &quot;CONTINUOUS&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>MARKATTITLE</strong>: a click at a title will mark a full line or a 
full column if they can be marked. Default: &quot;Yes&quot;. (since 3.16)</p>
<p><strong><a name="MARKMODE">MARKMODE</a></strong>:
  Defines the entity that can be marked: none, 
  lines, columns, (lines <span class="style2">or</span> columns), and cells. Possible values: &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;LIN&quot;, &quot;COL&quot;, 
    &quot;LINCOL&quot; or &quot;CELL&quot;. Default: &quot;NO&quot; 
    (no mark).</p>
<p><strong><a name="MARK">MARK</a><em>L:C</em></strong> (no redraw): marks a cell, a line or 
a column depending on 
MARKMODE, and returns cell, line or column mark state also according to MARKMODE. Can be &quot;1&quot; or 
&quot;0&quot;. If MARKMODE=LIN,COL,LINCOL use 0 to mark only the other element 
(ex: &quot;0:3&quot; set/get for column 3). Even when MARKMODE=LIN,COL,LINCOL you can 
specify a single cell address. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong><a name="MARKED">MARKED</a></strong>:
  String of &#39;0&#39; or &#39;1&#39; characters, informing which cells are 
  marked (indicated by value &#39;1&#39;). Use NULL to clear all marks, returns 
NULL if no marks. 
  The format of this character vector depends on the value of the MARKMODE attribute: if its value is CELL, the vector will have NUMLIN x NUMCOL positions, corresponding to all the cells in the matrix 
starting with all the cells of the first line, then the second line and so on. If its value is LIN, the vector will begin with letter 
&#39;L&#39; and will have further NUMLIN positions, each one corresponding to a line 
  in the matrix. If its value is COL, the vector will begin with letter &#39;C&#39; and will have further 
NUMCOL positions, each one corresponding to a 
  column in the matrix. If its value is LINCOL, the first letter, which can be either 
&#39;L&#39; or &#39;C&#39;, will indicate which of the above formats is being used. If you 
change the other mark attributes the marked cells are cleared. When setting the 
attribute the LIN and COL notation can be used even if MARKMODE=CELL. 
MULTIPLE and AREA are NOT considered when setting MARKED or MARKL:C.</p>
<p><strong>MARK<a name="MARKMULTIPLE">MULTIPLE</a></strong>:
  Defines if more than one entity defined by
  MARKMODE can be <strong>interactively</strong> 
  marked. Possible values: &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;. Default:
