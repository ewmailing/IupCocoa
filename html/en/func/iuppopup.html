<h2>IupPopup</h2>
<p>Shows a dialog or menu and restricts user 
  interaction only to the specified element. It is equivalent of creating a 
Modal dialog is some toolkits.</p>
<p>If another dialog is shown after <b>IupPopup</b> using <b>IupShow</b>, then its interaction will not be inhibited. Every 
<b>IupPopup</b> 
  call creates a new popup level that inhibits all previous dialogs interactions, but does not disable new ones 
(even if they were disabled by the Popup, calling <strong>IupShow</strong> will 
re-enable the dialog because it will change its popup level). 
  IMPORTANT: The popup levels must be closed in the reverse order they were created or unpredictable results will occur.</p>
<p>For a dialog this function will only return the control 
  to the application after a callback returns IUP_CLOSE, <b>IupExitLoop</b> is 
called, 
  or when the popup dialog is hidden, for example using <b>IupHide</b>. 
  For a menu it returns automatically after a menu item is selected. IMPORTANT:
  If a menu item callback returns IUP_CLOSE, 
  it will also ends the current popup level dialog. </p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>int IupPopup(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, int <strong>x</strong>, int <strong>y</strong>); [in C]
iup.Popup(<strong>ih</strong>: ihandle[, <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>: number]) -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]
or <strong>ih</strong>:popup(<strong>[x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>: number]) -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><b>ih</b>: Identifier of a dialog or a menu.<br>
<b>x</b>: horizontal position of the top-left corner of the window or menu, relative to the origin of the 
main screen.
    The following definitions can also be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IUP_LEFT:
    Positions the element on the left corner of 
    the main screen</li>
  <li>IUP_CENTER:
    Centers the element on the main screen</li>
  <li>IUP_RIGHT:
    Positions the element on the right corner of 
    the main screen</li>
  <li>IUP_MOUSEPOS:
    Positions the element on the mouse cursor</li>
  <li>IUP_CENTERPARENT: Horizontally centralizes the dialog relative to its 
  parent. Not valid for menus. (Since 3.0)</li>
  <li>IUP_CURRENT: use the current position 
    of the dialog. This is the default value 
  in Lua if the parameter is not defined. Not valid for menus. (Since 3.0)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>y</b>: vertical position of the top-left corner of the window or menu, relative to the origin of the
    main screen. The following definitions can also be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IUP_TOP:
    Positions the element on the top of the 
    main screen</li>
  <li>IUP_CENTER:
    Vertically centers the element on the main screen</li>
  <li>IUP_BOTTOM:
    Positions the element on the base of the 
    main screen</li>
  <li>IUP_MOUSEPOS:
    Positions the element on the mouse cursor</li>
  <li>IUP_CENTERPARENT: Vertically centralizes the dialog relative to its parent. 
	Not valid for menus. 
	(Since 3.0)</li>
  <li>IUP_CURRENT: use the current position 
    of the dialog. This is 
  the default value in Lua if the parameter is not defined. Not valid for 
	menus. (Since 3.0)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="style1">Returns:</span> IUP_NOERROR if 
  successful. Returns
  IUP_INVALID if not a dialog or menu.&nbsp; If there was an error returns
  IUP_ERROR..</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>It will call <b>IupMap</b> for the element.</p>
<p>The <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> values are the same as returned 
by the <a href="../attrib/iup_screenposition.html">SCREENPOSITION</a> attribute.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
IUP_MOUSEPOS position is the same as returned by the 
<a href="../attrib/iup_globals.html#cursorpos">CURSORPOS</a> global attribute.</span></p>
<p>See the <a href="../dlg/iupdialog.html#PLACEMENT">PLACEMENT</a> attribute for other position and show 
  options.</p>
<p>When IUP_CENTERPARENT is used but PARENTDIALOG is not defined then it is 
replaced by IUP_CENTER.</p>
<p>When IUP_CURRENT is used at the first time the dialog is shown then it will 
be replaced by IUP_CENTERPARENT.</p>
<p>The main screen area does not include additional monitors.</p>
<p><b>IupPopup</b> works just like <b>IupShowXY</b>, but it inhibits interaction with other dialogs 
that are visible and interrupts the processing until 
  IUP_CLOSE is returned in a callback, <strong>IupExitLoop</strong> is called, or the 
popup dialog is hidden. This is now a modal dialog. Although it 
  interrupts the processing, it does not destroy the dialog when it ends. To destroy the dialog, 
  <b>IupDestroy</b> must be called.</p>
<p>The MODAL attribute of the dialog will be changed internally to return Yes.</p>
<p>In GTK and Motif the inactive dialogs will still be moveable, resizable and changeable their Z-order. Although their 
  contents will be inactive, keyboard will be disabled, and they can not be closed from the close box.</p>
<p>When called for an already visible dialog (modal or not) it will update its 
position and <a href="../dlg/iupdialog.html#PLACEMENT">PLACEMENT</a>. If the 
already visible dialog is not modal then it will became modal and processing 
will be interrupted as a regular <strong>IupPopup</strong> (since 3.16). If the 
already visible dialog is modal then the function returns and it will NOT 
interrupt processing, the dialog still will remains MODAL. In other words, 
calling <strong>IupPopup</strong> a second time will just update the dialog 
position and it will not interrupt processing, and calling <strong>IupPopup</strong> 
for a dialog shown with <strong>IupShowXY</strong> will turn it a modal dialog.</p>
