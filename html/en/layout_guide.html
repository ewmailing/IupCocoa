<h3><a name="native">Native Sizes (Window and Client)</a></h3>
<p>Because of the dynamic nature of the abstract layout IUP elements have implicit many types of size. But the native 
  elements have only two types of size: <b>Window</b> and <b>Client</b>. The <b>Window</b> size reflects the bounding 
  rectangle of the element. The <b>Client</b> size reflects the inner size of the window that excludes the decorations 
  and margins. For many elements these two sizes are equal, but for many containers they are quite different. See some 
  examples below.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td width="33%" class="style2">
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/nativesize1.gif" width="297" height="199"></td>
      <td width="33%" class="style2">
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/nativesize2.gif" width="210" height="146"></td>
      <td width="34%" class="style2">
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/nativesize3.gif" width="268" height="204"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center></div>
<p>The IUP sizes (<strong>User</strong>, <strong>Natural</strong> and <strong>
Current</strong>) described below are all related to the <strong>Window</strong> 
size. </p>
<p>The native <b>Client</b> size is used only internally to reposition the elements in the abstract layout, but it is 
  available using the <a href="attrib/iup_clientsize.html">CLIENTSIZE</a> attribute.</p>
<h3><a name="iup">IUP Sizes</a></h3>
<h4>Natural Size</h4>
<p>IUP does not require that the application specifies the size of any element. The sizes are automatically calculated 
  so the contents of each element is fully displayed. This size is called <b>Natural</b> size. The 
<b>Natural</b> size 
  is calculated just before the element is mapped to the native system and every 
time <strong>IupMap</strong> is called, even if the element is already mapped.</p>
<p>The <b>Natural</b> size of a container is the size that allows all the elements inside the 
container to be fully 
  displayed.
Then the <strong>Natural</strong> size is calculated from the inner element to 
the outer element (the dialog).
<span class="style1">Important</span>: even if the element is invisible its size 
will be included in the size of its containers, except when FLOATING=Yes.</p>
<p>So consider the following code and its result. Each button size is large enough to display their respective text. 
  If the dialog size is increased or reduced by the size handlers in the dialog borders the buttons do not move or 
  change their sizes.</p>
<p>But notice that some controls do not have contents that can provide a <strong>
Natural</strong> size. In this case they usually have SIZE or RASTERSIZE 
pre-set.</p>
<p>To obtain the last computed <strong>Natural</strong> size of the control in pixels, use the read-only 
attribute <a href="attrib/iup_naturalsize.html">NATURALSIZE</a> (since 3.6).</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
<h4>User Size</h4>
<p>When the application defines the <a href="attrib/iup_size.html">SIZE</a> or 
<a href="attrib/iup_rastersize.html">RASTERSIZE</a> attributes, it changes 
the <b>User</b> size in IUP. The initial 
internal value is &quot;0x0&quot;. When set to NULL the <b>User</b> size is 
internally  set to &quot;0x0&quot;. If the element is <span class="style1">not 
mapped</span> then the returned value by SIZE or RASTERSIZE is the <strong>User</strong> 
size, if the element is mapped then the returned value is the <strong>Current</strong> 
size. To obtain the <strong>User</strong> size after the element is mapped use the USERSIZE 
attribute (since 3.12).</p>
<p>By default the layout computation uses the <strong>Natural</strong> size of 
the element to compose the layout of the dialog, but if the <strong>User</strong> 
size is defined then it is used <span class="style1">instead</span> of the <strong>Natural</strong> size. 
In this case the <strong>Natural</strong> size is not even computed. But there 
are two exceptions.</p>
<p>If the element is a container (not including the dialog) the <strong>User</strong> 
size will be used <span class="style1">instead</span> of the <strong>Natural</strong> size
<span class="style1">only</span> if <span class="style1">bigger</span> than the <strong>Natural</strong> size. 
So for containers the <strong>User</strong> size will also act as a minimum 
value for <strong>Natural</strong> size.</p>
<p>For the 
dialog, if the <strong>User</strong> 
size is defined then it is used <span class="style1">instead</span> of the <strong>Natural</strong> size, 
but the <strong>Natural</strong> size of the dialog is always computed. And if the <strong>User</strong> size is not defined, the <strong>Natural</strong> 
size is used only if <span class="style1">bigger</span> than the <strong>Current</strong> size, so in this 
case the dialog will always increase its size to fit all its contents. In other 
words, in this case the dialog will not shrink its Current size unless the
<strong>User</strong> size is defined. See 
the <a href="#SHRINK">SHRINK</a> attribute guide bellow for an alternative.</p>
<p>When the user is interactively changing the dialog size the <strong>Current</strong> 
size is updated. But the dialog contents will always occupy the Natural size 
available, being smaller or bigger than the dialog <strong>Current</strong> 
size.</p>
<p>When SIZE or 
RASTERSIZE attributes are set for the dialog (changing the <strong>User</strong> 
size) the <strong>Current</strong> size is also reset to &quot;0x0&quot;. Allowing the 
application to force an update of its <strong>Window</strong> size. To only 
change the <strong>User</strong> size in pixels, without resetting the <strong>
Current</strong> size, set the USERSIZE attribute (since 3.12).</p>
<h4>Current Size</h4>
<p>After the <strong>Natural</strong> size is calculated for all the elements in 
the dialog, the the <strong>Current</strong> size is set based on the available 
space in the dialog. So the <strong>Current</strong> size is set from the outer 
element (the dialog) to the inner element, in opposite of what it is done for 
the <strong>Natural</strong> size. </p>
<p>After all the elements have their <strong>Current</strong> size updated, the 
elements positions are calculated, and finally, after the element is mapped, the
<strong>Window</strong> size and position are set for the native elements. The
<strong>Window</strong> size is set exactly to the <strong>Current</strong> 
size.</p>
<p>After the element is mapped the returned value for SIZE or RASTERSIZE is the <b>Current</b> size. 
It actually returns the native 
<b>Window</b> size of the element. Before mapping, the returned value is the
<b>User</b> size.</p>
<p>Defining the SIZE attribute of the buttons in the example we can make all have the same size. (In the following 
  example the dialog size was changed after it was displayed on screen)</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="6" width="50%" id="AutoNumber2">
	<tr>
		<td width="50%" class="style2">
		<pre>dlg = iup.dialog
{
  iup.vbox
  {
    iup.button{title=&quot;Button Very Long Text&quot;, <b>size=&quot;50x&quot;</b>},
    iup.button{title=&quot;short&quot;, <b>size=&quot;50x&quot;</b>},
    iup.button{title=&quot;Mid Button&quot;, <b>size=&quot;50x&quot;</b>}
  }
  ;title=&quot;IupDialog&quot;, font=&quot;Helvetica, Bold 14&quot; 
}
dlg:show()</pre>
		</td>
		<td width="50%" class="style2">
		<img border="0" src="images/usersize.gif" width="279" height="214"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>So when EXPAND=NO (see below) for elements that are not containers if&nbsp; 
<b>User</b> size is defined then the <b>Natural</b> size is ignored.</p>
<p>If you want to adjust sizes in the dialog do it after the layout size and 
positioning are done, i.e. after the dialog is mapped or after <b>IupRefresh</b> is 
called.</p>
<h4>EXPAND</h4>
<p>Another way to increase the size of elements is to use the EXPAND attribute. When there is room in the container to 
  expand an element, the container layout will expand the elements that have the EXPAND attribute set to YES, HORIZONTAL 
  or VERTICAL accordingly, even if they have the <b>User</b> size defined.</p>
<p>The default is EXPAND=NO, but for containers is EXPAND=YES.</p>
<p>Using EXPAND in the example, we obtain the following result:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="6" width="50%" id="AutoNumber2">
	<tr>
		<td width="50%" class="style2">
		<pre>dlg = iup.dialog
{
  iup.vbox
  {
    iup.button{title=&quot;Button Very Long Text&quot;},
    iup.button{title=&quot;short&quot;, <b>expand=&quot;HORIZONTAL&quot;</b>},
    iup.button{title=&quot;Mid Button&quot;, <b>expand=&quot;HORIZONTAL&quot;</b>}
  }
  ;title=&quot;IupDialog&quot;, font=&quot;Helvetica, Bold 14&quot; 
}
dlg:show()</pre>
		</td>
		<td width="50%" class="style2">
		<img border="0" src="images/expand.gif" width="251" height="179"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>So for elements that are NOT containers, when EXPAND is enabled the <b>
Natural</b> size and the <b>User</b> size are ignored.</p>
<p>For containers the default behavior is to always expand or if expand is 
disabled they are limited to the <b>Natural</b> size. As a consequence (if the
<b>User</b> size is not defined in all the elements) the dialog contents can 
only expand and its minimum size is the <b>Natural</b> size, even if EXPAND is 
enabled for its elements. In fact the actual dialog size can be smaller, but its 
contents will stop to follow the resize and they will be clipped at right and 
bottom.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/no_shrink.gif" width="153" height="189"></p>
<p>
If the expansion is in the same direction of the box, for instance 
expand=&quot;VERTICAL&quot; in the Vbox of the previous example, then the expandable 
elements will receive equal spaces to expand according to the remaining empty 
space in the box. This is why elements in different boxes does not align 
perfectly when EXPAND is set.</p>
<h4><a name="SHRINK">SHRINK</a></h4>
<p>To reduce the size of the dialog and its containers to a size smaller than the
<b>Natural</b> size the SHRINK attribute of the dialog can be used. If set to 
YES all the containers of the dialog will be able to reduce its size. But be 
aware that elements may overlap and the layout result could be visually bad if 
the dialog size is smaller than its <strong>Natural</strong> size.</p>

<p>Notice that in the example the dialog initial size will be 0x0 because it is 
not defined. The picture shown was captured after manually resizing the dialog. So when using 
SHRINK usually you will also need to set the dialog initial size.</p>

	<tr>
		<td width="50%" class="style2">

<h3>Layout <a name="Hierarchy">Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>The layout of the elements of a dialog in IUP has a natural hierarchy because of the way they are composed 
  together.  </p>
<p>To create a node simply call one of the pre-defined constructors like <b>
IupLabel</b>, <b>IupButton</b>, <b>IupCanvas</b>, and so on. To create a branch 
just call the constructors of containers like <b>IupDialog</b>, <b>IupFrame</b>,
<b>IupVBox</b>, and so on. Internally they all call
<a href="func/iupcreate.html">IupCreate</a> to create branches or nodes. To 
destroy a node or branch call <a href="func/iupdestroy.html">IupDestroy</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the constructors already append children to its branch, but you can 
add other children using <a href="func/iupappend.html">IupAppend</a> or
<a href="func/iupinsert.html">IupInsert</a>. To 
remove from the tree call <a href="func/iupdetach.html">IupDetach</a>.</p>
<p>For the element to be visible <a href="func/iupmap.html">IupMap</a> must be 
called so it can be associated with a native control. <b>IupShow</b>, <b>
IupShowXY</b> or <b>IupPopup</b> will automatically call <b>IupMap</b> before 
showing a dialog. To remove this association call <a href="func/iupumap.html">
IupUnmap</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a call order to be able to call theses functions that depends on 
the state of the element. As you can see from these functions there are 3 
states: <b>created</b>, <b>appended</b> and <b>mapped</b>. From <b>created</b> 
to <b>mapped</b> it is performed one step at a time. Even when the constructor 
receives the children as a parameter <b>IupAppend</b> is called internally. When 
you <b>detach</b> an element it will be automatically <b>unmapped</b> if 
necessary. When you <b>destroy</b> an element it will be automatically <b>
detached</b> if necessary. So explicitly or implicitly, there will be always a call to:</p>
<pre>IupCreate  -&gt; IupAppend -&gt; IupMap
IupDestroy &lt;- IupDetach &lt;- IupUnmap</pre>
<p>A more simple and fast way to move an element from one position in the 
hierarchy to another is using <a href="func/iupreparent.html">IupReparent</a>.</p>
<p>The dialog is the root of the hierarchy tree. To retrieve the dialog of any 
element you can simply call
  <a href="func/iupgetdialog.html">IupGetDialog</a>, but there are other ways to navigate in the hierarchy tree.</p>
<p>To get all the children of a container call <a href="func/iupgetchild.html">
IupGetChild</a> or 
<a href="func/iupgetnextchild.html">IupGetNextChild</a>. To get just the next control with the same parent use 
<a href="func/iupgetbrother.html">IupGetBrother</a>. To get the parent of a 
control call <a href="func/iupgetparent.html">IupGetParent</a>.</p>
<p>In Lua, if the container was created in Lua and children specified during the 
creating, you can access any child of the 
element using the notation &quot;elem[n]&quot;, where n is the index of the child. 
For example:</p>
<pre>
dlg = iup.dialog
{
  iup.hbox
  {
    iup.button{title="Ok&quot;}, 
    iup.button{title="Cancel&quot;},
  }
}
cancel_button = dlg[1][2]</pre>
<p>
But this will not work for dynamically modified containers, for instance when 
iup.Append or iup.Deatch are used to add or remove elements from the container. 
For those containers use the API functions like iup.GetChild.<br>
</p>
<h3>Layout <a name="Display">Display</a></h3>
<p>The layout size and positioning is automatically updated by <b>IupMap</b>.
  <b>IupMap</b> also updates the dialog layout 
  even if it is already mapped, so using it or using <b>IupShow</b>, 
  <b>IupShowXY</b> or 
  <b>IupPopup</b> (they all call 
  <b>IupMap</b>) will also update the dialog layout. The layout size and 
positioning can be manually updated using 
  <a href="func/iuprefresh.html">IupRefresh</a>, even if the dialog is not 
mapped.</p>
<p>After changing containers attributes or element sizes that affect the layout the elements are NOT immediately repositioned. Call
  <b>IupRefresh</b> for an element inside the dialog to update the dialog 
layout. </p>
<p>The Layout update is done in two phases. First the layout is computed, this 
can be done without the dialog being mapped. Second is the native elements 
update from the computed values.</p>
<p>The Layout computation is done in 3 steps: <strong>Natural</strong> size 
computation, update the <strong>Current</strong> size and update the position. </p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Natural</strong> size computation is done from the inner elements up 
to the dialog (first for the children then the element). <strong>User</strong> 
	size (set by RASTERSIZE or SIZE) is used as the <strong>Natural</strong> 
	size if defined, if not usually the contents of the element are used to 
	calculate the <strong>Natural</strong> size.</li>
	<li>Then the <strong>Current</strong> size is computed starting at the dialog down to 
the inner elements on the layout hierarchy (first the element then the 
	children). Children <strong>Current</strong> size is computed according to 
	layout distribution and containers decoration. At the children if EXPAND is 
	set, then the size specified by the parent is used, else the natural size is 
	used. </li>
	<li>Finally the position is computed starting at the dialog down to the 
	inner elements on the layout hierarchy, after all sizes are computed.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Update">Element Update</a></h3>
<p>Usually IUP automatically updates everything for the application, for 
instance there is no need to force a display update after an attribute is 
changed. But there are some situations where you need to force an update. Here 
is a summary of the functions that can be used to update an element state:</p>
<p>
<a href="func/iupupdate.html">IupUpdate</a> - update the element look by letting 
the system to schedule a redraw. </p>
<p><a href="func/iupredraw.html">IupRedraw</a> - has the same effect of <strong>
IupUpdate</strong> but forces the element to redraw now.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="func/iuprefresh.html">IupRefresh</a> - if the application 
changed some attribute that affects the natural size, for instance SIZE or 
RASTERSIZE among others, the actual element size is NOT immediately updated. 
That's because it can affect the size and position of other elements in the 
dialog. <strong>IupRefresh</strong> will force an update in the layout of the 
whole dialog, and of course if an element has its size changed its appearance 
will be automatically updated.</p>
<p><a href="func/iupflush.html">IupFlush</a> - process all events that are 
waiting to be processed. When you set an attribute, a system event is generated, 
but it will wait until is processed by the event loop. Sometimes the application 
needs an immediate result, so calling <strong>IupFlush</strong> will process 
that event but it will also process every other event that was waiting to be 
processed, so other callbacks could be trigger during <strong>IupFlush</strong> 
call.</p>
